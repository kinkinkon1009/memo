When you engage in a habit you want to quit ( like touching your hair when stressed ) log the time in your planner or a memo app. Also, record the time elapsed since the last occurrence. 

If the habit is unconscious, you may realize how frequently you repeat it. By acknowledging it, reflecting on it each time you log it, and reinforcing awareness, you can gradually break the habit.

In just two or three days, you may be able to stop an unconscious bad habit.
